I am an Ocean Scientist interested in the physical aspects of the upper ocean and surf zone. I use observations and numerical models to better understand these complex regions and their relationship to the adjacent atmospheric and coastal environments.

Together with researchers and scientists at the Air-Sea Interaction lab at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I am developing methods to derive sub-mesoscale upper-ocean and bathymetric parameters form aerial imagry. This work supports research on coastal geomorphology, air-sea gas exchange and ocean surface mixing.
