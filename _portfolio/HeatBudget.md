Temperature is a useful indicator for many ocean processes, but temperature is a non-conserved quantity. Heat budgets quantify the flux of heat into and out of an area and can help quantify physical processes affecting heat transfer. In this year-long observational study, we looked at the role breaking waves play in the surfzone and how they affect the total heat content. Additionally, we quantified dynamics of internal wave runup, and the internal wave affect on temperature variability in the surfzone.
