Key results:
1) A high resolution nearshore (shoreline to 6-m depth) heat budget, including the surfzone, closes at subtidal and tidal time scales.
2) Baroclinic advective and solar heat fluxes are the strongest terms and their relative contributions depend on mean stratification.
3) Residual in the heat budget is partially due to neglected alongshore advection of temperature anomalies.
