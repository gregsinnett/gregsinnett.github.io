Key results:
1) Shoaling nonlinear internal solitary waves were observed over three fortnights using moorings and an optical cable from 2000 m depth to the top of Dongsha Reef in the South China Sea.
2) Packet formation was common from the 500 to 300 m isobaths but almost all waves broke by the time they reached 100 m depth and subsequently presented a turbulent, transformed wave runup environment.
3) Possible outcomes are classified according to the wave type, incident wave amplitude, propagation direction, and ambient stratification.
